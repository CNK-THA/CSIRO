Hello Tzy Hui!

Nice to meet you I'm Nick! That is indeed a very unique name! Do you know what it means?

My interests at the moment are in the usability/AI/Assistive technology/Cybersecurity space! I just finished research with my prof on cybersecurity and online human behaviours looking at what people think about/react when faced with a potential phishing/scamming emails. A very interesting and fun project to do!
That's very cool you're interested in psychology! Are you a current psyc student yourself or is planning to go into this field?

I think psyc is a very handy skill/understanding to have since it can be coupled with any other majors. But speaking from experience, having just purely psyc without aiming to become a psychologist/psychiatrist can be a little challenging when finding jobs!

That's a very good point with the alien stuff. I guess we don't really have a concrete evidence that they do exist BUT logically/"empirically" speaking we've found all the base components to sustain life i.e. water on other planets so would be real weird if we're the only ones out here!
If I'm a millionaire I'd probably still go to work/study as normal. Invest those money to grow it even more and probably a quick trip to my local buffet restaurant just to celebrate!!

How're things going in Singapore with the COVID stuff? I've been to Singapore years ago and saw the Merlion, pretty cool!!

Take care!
Nick
